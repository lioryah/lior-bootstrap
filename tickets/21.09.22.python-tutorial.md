## Ticket Text Statistics

### Part 1

Write a programm, that has one requred parameter - path to text file.
The programm should read the file,
Calculate for each word (token) its entries. example for file

```
I go to shop to buy some clothes.
He went to shop to buy a chair.
```

should output:

```
I: 1
to: 3
...
```

### Part 2

The programm should receive ist of paths and show statistics

1. per file
2. total (in all the text)
3. token in files statistics

- for term X show in how many files appears X

python textcount.py text-file1.txt text-file2.txt

programm can receive one path to directory instead of list of paths,
list all files in this dir and perform same action.
