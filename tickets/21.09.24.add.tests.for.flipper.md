# add basic tests for flipper

> [@@ydlink=github_issue](https://github.com/lioryah/lior-bootstrap/issues/3)

1. read about packages
2. we create package liorboot
   - i moved module hi (hi.py) into it
   - also moved liorboot/flipper.py
3. add to package dir module flipper_qa.py

- fliper_qa should have a validate_flipper method
- expose this method with fire to bash
- validate_flipper should receive two parameters source, dest
- implement simple validation when text is " " (space)
- validate_flipper should decide if image is flipped correctly

4. add trun-test-metrics task to main Taskfile

- add to run-sample new command entry
- wich call to filepper_qa.py with src and dest
- this task should have fail if not mached

5. implement (add to validate_flipper code) validate_with_text
   try to use pytesseract package for ocr for text
   - **This Step is required before playing with hand recognition**
